# Corn-Classification
## The problem is to classify corn leaf diseases..
* The dataset contains images, and it includes four classes. You can check it out.
  
-> I'm utilizing a transfer model for training the data

-> Using a transfer model means leveraging pre-trained knowledge to enhance current data training. It's a way to efficiently apply previously learned information to improve 
   learning outcomes.
   
* I'm utilizing the VGG16 model for my work. It's a powerful convolutional neural network known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks
* The VGG16 model achieves an accuracy of 89%.
###  I wrote a Medium article explaining the transfer model, its architecture, and the classification of corn.
